TODO: 

- Refactor to modular code files. 
- Write function specs + documentation 
- evaluate cache policy ? 
- Train_Test_Split() is not used anywhere ? 

- High level tests for both old codebases + write some result invariants 
- Unit Tests 
- Integration Tests  

- Code Specific Notes: 
    - Remove SingleNameSpace() instances (change to list / dict / python class)
    - Reduce Session File dependency across code base. 
    - Refactor (while True) in synthetic_spiketrain() 
    - Make an enum for categories and conditions
    - use python3 bc sklearn has some float issue


- scalability 1 neuron vs multiple neurons , different tpyes of input

session file structure 
1: meta 
2:
